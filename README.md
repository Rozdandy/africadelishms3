 There are about 55 countries on the African continent with a population estimated of 1.3 billion. Inspite of the numerous diverse cultures and ethnicities, the African cuisine or recipes is the least pronounced one among other continents of the world. For instance, here in the Netherlands, the African shops and restaurants that sell her recipes are very few in comparison to the asian continents. Does it mean other continents are not very aware of the African uncountable, tasty, relish, healthy, and energtic African recipes? In other instances, due to the diverse cultures and ethnicities, many indegenous African people are not aware of the various food recipes that available to them from other groups.

Therefore, Afric & delish is an online foodbook where users can surf other African recipes, able to register and also submit their country's cuisine. Afric & delish is a recipe website for people who love to explore continental dishes right in their homes. It avail the opportunity for gourmets and epicures to search for tasty, and palatable different African recipes to prepare for their maximum enjoyment. The concept of the foodbook would allow users to explore the available menus, create theirs, edit or update them and also delete them if they are not needed again. The concept of the   CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE (CRUD) are the crux of the lecture for Milestone three Project at Code Institute, which this project would be built upon.
